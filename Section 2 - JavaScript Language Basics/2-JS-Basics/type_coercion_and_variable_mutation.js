/* TYPE COERCION AND VARIABLE MUTATION */

// Type coercion example
var name = 'Paulo';
var age = 20;

// Transforming the number variable "age" to a sting variable
console.log(name + ' is ' + age + ' years old.');

// Adding the number variable "age" to itself, as a number
console.log(age + age);

// Declare a variable and not the declare its value immediately the variable is undefined)
console.log(occupation);

occupation = 'student';

// Variable mutation example
