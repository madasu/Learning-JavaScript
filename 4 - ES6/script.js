/*

* Suppose that you're working in a small town admnistration and you're in charge of two town elements: 
* 1. Parks
* 2. Streets

* It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name an a build year. 

* At the end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
* 1. Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/park area)
* 2. Average age of each town's park (formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)
* 3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
* 4. Total and average length of the town's streets 
* 5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge (if the size is unknown, the default is normal)

* All the report data should be printed to the console. 

HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.
